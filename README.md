# Keezenspel

![keezenspel](ReadMeResources/keezenspel.png)

The construction of the Keezenspel board happens as follows:
The distance between each cell is constant.

If the distance between two cells is distance D:

The orange line is then 4D long
The arm from the first red dot to the first yellow dot is 6D

The first red dot is the starting point from which the boardsection is constructed.
The green line is half the orange line (2D) and does not depend on the number of players.
The purple line PL is then: PL = tan(alpha)*GL where alpha=90-180/n
